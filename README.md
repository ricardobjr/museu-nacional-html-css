<h1> museu-nacional-html-css </h1>

### The project was developed with the aim of applying basic html and css3 concepts, with the objective of simulating the web page of a fictional museum. 
In it we can find one file in HTML format and a folder containing twelve images. The project allows the user to see how '<section>' and '<article>' tags can be applied using HTML5 in conjunction with CSS3.

>✔️ Status: finished.

### Below I will describe how the project can be run.

  1️⃣ Clone the repository on your computer.<br>
  2️⃣ Click on the "index.html" file.<br>
  3️⃣ Through the page structure, you can see how items are organized through blocks.<br>

#### The project was developed based on what was taught within Udemy's "Desenvolvimento Completo Web" course.
